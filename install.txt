Basic Functionality:

Script will run in the background waiting for an SMTP connection (email) to be recieved. Upon receipt it will check if the email is from an address it trusts then if
it is it will attempt to take action on it. In this case it will parse the xml returned from gomez to see if the severity
level is as bad as or worse than the action_level specified in the config file. If the severity matches the ip of the fqdn will 
be removed the from the dns records and the failover_address will be inserted in it's place. If the current and failover ips are the same the script will do nothing


Install steps for gomez handler:

Requirements: Ubuntu OS
		    Python (following packages used: os, sys, ConfigParser, re, smtpd, asyncore, xml.dom.minidom, logging, logging.handlers)
		    
Port used:	SMTP (25)


Install:
1. Create /etc/gomez_alerts  ( $: sudo mkdir /etc/gomez_alerts )

2. Copy the dynect.cfg to that directory ( $: sudo cp dynect.cfg /etc/gomez_alerts/dynect.cfg )

3. Edit and save the dynect.cfg to add your dynect customer name, user name and password ( $: sudo vi dynect.cfg /etc/gomez_alerts/dynect.cfg )

4. Start the script from whereever you wish to store it, alertSmtp.py and dynect.py must be in the same directory ( $ sudo python alertSmtp.py )



Explination of .cfg file options:


[credentials]
cn : <customer name> // the dynect customer name
un : <username> // the dynect user name
pwd : <password> // the dynect password

[dns_settings]
ttl : 30 // ttl setting for zone entries
zone: <zone> // zone being monitored
fqdn: <fqdn> // fqdn being monitored
failover_address:<ip_address> // ip address to replace a failed server with

[smtp_settings]
host : 0.0.0.0 // host name of addresses to allow mail from (0.0.0.0 is all addresses)

[gomez_alert_settings]
action_level: SEVERE // Lowest level to do a removal for (WARNING and SEVERE are the two allowed values)

[logging]
log_level: INFO // logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL are the levels from most logging to least)
log_file: /etc/gomez_alerts/gomezAlert.log // log to write to
log_byte_size: 20000 // max size in bytes for the main log before wbacking up and starting fresh (up to 5 logs will be stored)



Notes:
- Using the smtp server object out of python queues incoming requests so none should be lost
- Hosts are configure to accept from 0.0.0.0/0 - this can be changed if we get the single ip address of the sending server (keep in mind that if we give an ip or a host name resolved to an 
									ip it will only accept from that ip which may be bad since they are sure to have a large number of servers doing the monitoring)
- This will run in the background and only reads the full config on startup however it will read and updated failover_address directly prior to checking if it should replace
					. Changes made require to stop and start the service which currently is a "ps -ef" to find the pid then "sudo kill -9 <pid>"
- Logging is controlled from within the dynect.cfg options.
